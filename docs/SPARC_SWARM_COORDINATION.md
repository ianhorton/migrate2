# SPARC-Based Swarm Coordination for CDK Improvements

## üéØ Objective

Execute Sprints 2-4 using **SPARC methodology** with **swarm coordination** and **phase gate oversight**.

## üèóÔ∏è SPARC + Swarms = Controlled Parallelism

### The Problem with Pure Swarms
‚ùå Agents run autonomously without checkpoints
‚ùå No review until completion
‚ùå Hard to catch design issues early
‚ùå Integration problems discovered late

### The SPARC Solution with Swarms
‚úÖ Agents work in parallel **per SPARC phase**
‚úÖ Coordinator reviews at **each phase gate**
‚úÖ Issues caught early (Specification/Pseudocode)
‚úÖ Clean integration (Architecture reviewed upfront)

## üìã SPARC Phase Gates

### Phase 1: Specification (S)
**What**: Define requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases
**Parallel**: All agents write specs simultaneously
**Gate**: Coordinator reviews all specs before proceeding

### Phase 2: Pseudocode (P)
**What**: Design algorithms and logic flows
**Parallel**: All agents write pseudocode simultaneously
**Gate**: Coordinator reviews pseudocode, checks for conflicts

### Phase 3: Architecture (A)
**What**: Define file structure, modules, interfaces
**Parallel**: All agents design their architectures
**Gate**: Coordinator reviews for integration issues

### Phase 4: Refinement (R)
**What**: TDD implementation (tests ‚Üí code)
**Parallel**: All agents implement simultaneously
**Gate**: Coordinator monitors progress, helps with blockers

### Phase 5: Completion (C)
**What**: Integration, testing, documentation
**Sequential**: Coordinator integrates all work
**Gate**: Final verification and approval

- [ ] No conflicting requirements
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Integration points clear

**Action**: Approve or request revisions

### Gate 2: After Pseudocode Phase

## üìù Agent Instructions Template

Each agent receives:

```markdown
You are working on Sprint X using SPARC methodology with swarm coordination.

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW:
1. Complete SPECIFICATION phase first
2. Store result in memory: swarm/sprintX/phase=specification
3. WAIT for coordinator approval at gate
4. Only proceed to PSEUDOCODE after approval
5. Repeat for each phase: P, A, R

COORDINATION:
- Store all outputs in docs/SPARC_SPRINTX_*.md files
- Update memory with progress
- Report blockers immediately
- Use TDD in Refinement phase
- Follow Sprint 1 patterns for quality

INTEGRATION:
- Your code will merge with Sprints 1, Y, Z
- Check memory for other agents' progress
- Avoid file conflicts (you own specific directories)
- Test integration points

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All SPARC phases complete with approval
- 100% test coverage
- Clean build
- No integration conflicts
```
